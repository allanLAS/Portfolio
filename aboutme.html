      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm originally from north coast, Mombasa specifically Nyali. I recently finished my <span class="course">telecommunication engineering</span> course at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, main campus. I've in the past worked for mabati rolling mills as an intern in the IT department. I've also worked for siginon logistics as a logistics officer and also in the finance department</p>

      <h3>Job experience</h3>
        <p>I decided to take a class on programming so as to advance my career path of being a telecommunication and electrical engineering. Also as the world advances more on the technology side, I want to acquire relevant skills that will prove relevant in the near future and programming happens to be one of those critical skills.</p>
    
      <h4>Interests and Hobbies</h4>
        <p>My current interests are sports namely football and rugby, gaming and fitness. My hobbies are playing playstation and hanging out with my friends </p>
